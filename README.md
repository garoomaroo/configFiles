Don't use this, I'm on Codeberg now: [https://codeberg.org/blopes](url)

# configFiles
My personal configfiles for GTK, Hyprland, Sway, etc.
# Installation
Most of these files/directories go in `/home/[user]/.config/`, however some of these, namely gentoo, vim, gtk2 & zsh go in different directories:
- `gentoo`: `portage` goes in `/etc/`, `kernel/[version]` goes in /usr/src/linux-[version];
- `.vimrc`, `.zshrc` and `.gtkrc-2.0` go in your home folder.
# Notes
these kinda suck. they're very simple and don't stray from the defaults too much (except for nvim) so don't use them :)
